 *  \brief Asynchronous Transfer Library
 *
 * AXL is used to transfer a file from one path to another using
 * synchronous and asynchronous methods. This can only be done between
 * storage tiers, AXL does not (yet) support movement within a storage
 * tier (such as between 2 compute nodes). Asynchronous methods
 * include via pthreads, IBM BB API, Cray Datawarp. AXL will create
 * directories for destination files. */
